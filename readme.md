# Kyber KEM and PKE Implementation

This repository contains a Python-based implementation framework for a Kyber-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Public Key Encryption (PKE) scheme.

## Module Overview

The project is structured into the following main modules:

-   `kem/`: Intended for the Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism. It includes functions for key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation.
    -   **Status:** Currently contains placeholder implementations. Operations use `os.urandom()` and do not perform actual cryptographic computations.
-   `pke/`: Intended for the Kyber Public Key Encryption scheme. It includes functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption.
    -   **Status:** Currently contains placeholder implementations. Operations use `os.urandom()` and do not perform actual cryptographic computations.
-   `utils/`: Intended to house common cryptographic utilities, such as hash functions, polynomial arithmetic, and serialization helpers.
    -   **Status:** Contains basic structure but is largely unimplemented.
-   `benchmarks/`: Contains scripts to measure the performance of the KEM and PKE operations.

## Benchmarking

Performance benchmarks are available for both the KEM and PKE modules.

### Available Scripts

-   `benchmarks/benchmark_kem.py`: Benchmarks the KEM operations (keygen, encapsulate, decapsulate).
-   `benchmarks/benchmark_kyber.py`: Benchmarks the PKE Kyber operations (keygen, encrypt, decrypt) for different Kyber parameter sets (Kyber512, Kyber768, Kyber1024).

### How to Run

To run the benchmarks, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the scripts using Python:

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark_kem.py
python benchmarks/benchmark_kyber.py
```

### Output

The benchmark scripts will output the average time taken for each cryptographic operation (e.g., key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, encryption, decryption) over a predefined number of iterations. Timings are typically reported in seconds per operation.

### Important Note on Current Implementations

**The `kem` and `pke` modules currently feature placeholder implementations only.**

-   The functions within these modules (e.g., `kem.keygen`, `pke.encrypt`) use `os.urandom()` to generate byte strings that mimic the expected sizes of public keys, secret keys, ciphertexts, and shared secrets.
-   **No actual cryptographic operations are performed.** The underlying mathematical computations required for the Kyber algorithm (or any secure cryptographic scheme) are not yet implemented.
-   Consequently, the benchmark results generated by `benchmark_kem.py` and `benchmark_kyber.py` reflect the performance of these placeholder functions (i.e., primarily the speed of `os.urandom()` and basic Python function calls). **These timings are NOT representative of a real cryptographic implementation and should not be used for any security assessments or true performance comparisons against other cryptographic libraries.**

The primary purpose of these placeholders and benchmarks at this stage is to establish the project structure, define module interfaces, and provide a framework for future development and performance testing once the actual cryptographic logic is integrated.
